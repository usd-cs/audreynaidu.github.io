               Who I am:
                My name is Audrey Naidu! I am about to be a rising Senior at the University of San diego!
                I am majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Human Computer Interactions. I
                was born and raised in San Diego and before USD, I graduated from The Bishop's School in 2021.
                I have two rescue dogs, a pug mix named Roxie and a German Shepherd mix named Lily. While juggling
                my responsibilities as a student, I also work at Pacific Training Center, a boxing gym in La Jolla, California.

              </p>
              <p>
                Professional info:
                I am currently a student, so I do not have any full time work in Computer Science, but I have been pursuing
                several summer internships. Last summer, Summer 2023, I worked for Integral Technologies on a Parser that parses
                a csv file, organizes the data, and incorporates it into their online database. I've also interned for VP Tech Inc
                since 2018, and completed a multitude of smaller projects that include a fake review detector, website for database
                extraction, data verification, and data collection. At my job at Pacific Training Center, I am a Boxing and Muay Thai
                instructor and I teach both group and private classes. I also have experience with working at the front desk,
                answering phones, and navigating the mindbody system.
               </p>
               <p>
                Hobbies:
                 As aforementioned, I am a Boxing and Muay Thai instructor, and it is a large part of my life. In addition to my other committments,
                 I train 6 days a week for at least 3 hours a day. I've competed in Thailand twice and I am both a national and
                 international Muay Thai title-holder. I also enjoy Running, reading, and a few video games when
                 I have time.

              <h3>Digital Monopoly Simulation</h3>
              <p>
               Motivation of the project:
                When we heard that we could choose our own project for our final project in Object Oriented Programming,
                my group and I knew that we wanted to create something fun and something that people would want to play
                or use while still adhering to the Object Oriented Principles. We all agreed a board game would be exciting,
                but I suggested monopoly to add an element of uncertainty to a board that is otherwise unchanging. Once we agreed
                on the idea, the design came very naturally to us and we were all on board and excited to make this
                implementation!

              </p>
              <p>
              Functional requirements/what the project does:
                This project is a digital monopoly simulation. It allows users to play monopoly using the command terminal
                and to see the visuals with a GUI we created. Instead of having to buy an entire monopoly board, users can
                play the game right from their computer as long as they have the source files. It works by setting up the board
                before each game into set positions, and then the gameplay is dependant on the number of users playing and the number of rounds.
                There can be 3 to 8 players and up to 100 rounds. We decided to make the game round based instead of waiting until
                one single winner as monopoly can take a very long time and players may not want to play for so long. With our
                version, players can choose the length of game they would like to play and have a decided winner at the end of
                that. The winner is calculated based on not only their final balance but also their net worth of properties.
              </p>
              <p>
              Project design:
                We chose to use Java for this project because of its wide variety of resources and libraries. We were able to
                come up with the design easily due to the resources and guidance we were given throughout our Object Oriented
                Programming Class. We decided that an Object Oriented Design best fit a game like this and we were able to
                split up the parts of the game into classeds. We had a board which contained Game Squares and there were many
                types of classes that extended Game Square. The Player and Simulator section was another separate part of the design,
                which specialized in the user interaction with the Game Squares and the actual iteration and user experience
                of the game itself. Finally, our design utilized the Swing framework for the visual, as it provided a great way to
                move the user dots across the hand-drawn board.
              </p>
              <p>
              Implementation:
                I was responsible for the Board and Game Squares portion of the design. I went through test-driven development
                during this project and I found that it was incredibly helpful to ensure that I was covering all the boundary cases
                before I even wrote my classes. I created separate classes for each type of Game Square and extensions of a particular kind
                of Game Square- Property, things that could be bought and sold. Those included LandPlots, Utilities, and Railroads.
                The non Property game squares were corner squares, which did not cost money, and had values of Go To Jail, just visiting jail, free parking, or
                the go square. Landplots had color values which determined their cost which were stored in enumerators and they
                also contained development levels that players could upgrade, starting from house, and going up to apartment and then
                hotel. The most challenging parts of my implementation was to figure out the encapsulation and which class
                I should be writing some of my methods and storing the instance variables.
